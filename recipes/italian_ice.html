        </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 cups of fresh fruit</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons of honey or granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice</li>
            <li>3 cup ice, divided</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a food processor or high-powered blender, blend
                the fruit, honey or sugar, lemon juice, and 2 cups
                of ice until completely smooth. Taste and blend in
                more honey or sugar, if needed.
            </li>
            <li>Pour the mixture into a 13x9-inch baking dish and
                freeze for 30 minutes. Remove the ice from the freezer
                and scrape with a fork until slushy. Continue to freeze
                for another 2 hours.
            </li>
            <li>Scoop the ice into cups. If the ice is too hard to scoop,
                let it sit for 5 minutes to soften, or blend the ice in a 
                blender until slushy, then scoop into cups.
            </li>
        </ol>
